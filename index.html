We discussed and finalized on the following points:
1). Try to merge different ontologies scraped from web into one main ontology (to find relations we can try out the conceptnet or wordnet features)
2). Analyze goal description to extract all the objectives and constraints
3). Discussed about four machine learning algorithms to try (rule based, markov chain, advanced markov chain, CHAID tool)

We discussed the following points to try:
1). Dynamically extend the ontology to accept user inputs and for IoT kind actions. The scenario we talked about: go for grocery shopping and automatically generating the list of stuff to buy at the store.Assumption: the household refrigerator as an IoT device which outputs the list of stuffs that needs to be refilled (E.g., milk).
2). Talked about scenarios on identify the routines to provide suggestions.
3). Talked about the three proposed research questions:
RQ1.Which machine learning algorithm performs better in predicting next question to ask the 
         end-users?
RQ2. What are the most important features in predicting the next question to ask the end-user?
RQ3. How end-users feel about using the tool?  
4). Discussed on the scenarios and how we can add more scenarios to the knowledge base domains so we can experiment with larger samples.
